I have been experimenting this week with circuit design and pcb layout tools. My experience is with [Altium](http://www.altium.com.au/altium-designer/overview)
 but the price is rather hefty for my fairly simple requirements and
while I have used Altium for a few years I never actually liked it,
there are a lot of issues with the system.  I considered [the](https://easyeda.com/) [various](http://circuitmaker.com/) [online](https://upverter.com/) [tools](https://123d.circuits.io/) and [Eagle](http://www.cadsoftusa.com/) before deciding to give [KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org/) a go.

[KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org/)
 is an open source bundle of tools which has been rapidly increasing in
quality over the last few years. CERN is providing professional
development support and they have recently transferred from a ‚Äòbuild the
 source‚Äô release structure to standard point releases.

I have played with KiCad for most of the week. It is good, I could do everything I needed to for the basic board I was doing, but some of it was a struggle. There are a lot of rough edges, however the community seems strong and most of the issues I encountered are in the process of being fixed.

There are several projects under the KiCad banner which loosely
interoperate, it seems they have had varying amounts of coordination
over the years. Kicad itself is a project manager and application
laucher. Eeschema is the schematic design software. Pcbnew does the PCB
layout. There are other tools I haven‚Äôt played with yet, such as a
gerber viewer.

One of the issues is the cooperation between these applications. For
example the controls such as keyboard shortcuts and mouse behaviour are
inconsistent (This is flagged to be fixed by introducing a global
shortcut manager [üîó](http://www.ohwr.org/projects/cern-kicad/wiki/UI_improvements).


For a while (since fixed) pcbnew had panelization features available
when launched standalone but not when launched from within kicad [üîó](http://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/212252). These sort of problems mean that it feels more like using several different programs than a unified suite.

## <span id="Breaking_news">Breaking news</span>

I have published a writeup of the board I designed, at [/grideye-usb/](/grideye-usb/).

## <span id="Eeschema">Eeschema</span>

Eeschema is nice and familiar, you can place parts, connect wires,
create named nets etc. I had a very simple five component board so had
no need of the advanced features. However there was obvious
functionality for buses and a fair bit of support for nested sheets.
There is annotation tool to name your parts and a basic rule checker to
catch mistakes.

### <span id="Bonus">Bonus</span>

A nice bonus for Eeschema is the ability to have two names on a net.
This is a bit controversial, Altium forbids it but I like it. Some times
 a line has two roles, such as being the MISO communication line during
programming and the I2C interrupt line during normal operation. I like
being able to create a named net for each role and connect both to the
pin of the chip. The PCB layout program needs a single name, Eeschema
handles this by arbitrarily picking one of them.

### <span id="Missing_Feature">Missing Feature</span>

Altium has a feature they call [directives](https://techdocs.altium.com/display/ADOH/Using+Design+Directives+in+a+Schematic+Document#UsingDesignDirectivesinaSchematicDocument-PCB-relateddirectives).
 This allows a pair of wires to be identified to be routed as a
differential pair. You can also specify net classes, so as to specify
increased track widths for the power rail or the required clearance on a
 high voltage track. KiCad does allow this to be done in Pcbnew but I
feel the schematic, as the documentation for the design, should contain
this information. This is particularly important if the layout and
design are performed by different people.

### <span id="Awkward">Awkward</span>

Eeschema‚Äôs use of dragging with the left mouse button is odd. In most
 applications this would perform a group select, in eeschema it selects
and begins to move the components. Copy/paste is done by holding down
shift before doing a selection. The oddness and learning curve aside,
this doesn‚Äôt scale well. There is no way of selecting a group of objects
 so you can‚Äôt do a group delete, you can‚Äôt change the properties of a
group or resize multiple wires together. Using the copy/paste you can‚Äôt
double check what you have selected before doing a copy, multiple pastes
 require the full process to be run again and you can‚Äôt change sheets.
The move is still the action regardless of the tool selected, so
dragging with the wire tool actually does a select/move and placing a
box like a sub-sheet must be done with two clicks not a drag.

I suspect the select behaviour will be changed in the same batch of work as the shortcut improvements. [üîó](http://www.ohwr.org/projects/cern-kicad/wiki/UI_improvements)

### <span id="Ugly">Ugly</span>

I should open by saying I couldn‚Äôt really get my head around the
schematic libraries. My understanding is that a library file can hold
multiple components but I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to put a second
component into a library file. I did see notes suggesting that you merge
 two libraries by editing them by hand.

Several people have created their own tools to try and assist managing libraries [üîó](http://kicad.rohrbacher.net/quicklib.php) [üîó](https://github.com/atalax/python-eeschema) [üîó](https://gist.github.com/cpavlina/dc0bf5f5c018d43fa736). The existence of these tools indicates that many others have also encountered problems.

There is hidden magic behind the library process. For example to
create a power component, basically a power net flag, the pin must be
hidden. The pin still gets a wire connected to it but if it is not
hidden it doesn‚Äôt connect to the power net and you get unconnected
errors when running the rule check. This isn‚Äôt documented, the nice
folks in the IRC channel explained it to me.

There is also documented hidden magic where some parts, fortunately
none I used, have hidden VCC pins so they magically get the power rail
without cluttering your schematic. Which is not so useful in the modern
environment of multiple signal levels.

The developers are well aware of all of these issues, half the roadmap entries for eeschema are related to component editing. [üîó](http://kicad-source-mirror.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Documentation/development/road-map/#implement-sweet-component-libraries-sch_sweet)
 The plan seems to be to migrate the backend of the schematic library to
 the pcb library file format and work. Then build better editing tools
on top. The PCB library tool is a significant step forward.

## <span id="Pcbnew">Pcbnew</span>

![Pcbnew screen shot showing top layer](/posts/images/wp/pcbnew.screenshot.med.png "Pcbnew screenshot")

It took me a while to realise that there are actually three different
 PCB programs bundled into Pcbnew. They are listed in the view menu as
three different display modes: default, OpenGL, and Cairo. This is not,
as you might expect, just a different display engine. Some features are
not available in all modes and some features work differently depending
which mode you are in. I found Cairo ran very slowly on my poor ancient
laptop so I just used default and OpenGL.

Differential routing is a relatively new feature and is only
implemented in OpenGL. In the default view the feature on the menu is
simply disabled, grayed out, no feedback is provided as to how to enable
 it. [üîó](https://bugs.launchpad.net/kicad/+bug/1569180)

There are other, lesser issues:

* In GL mode the scroll bar arrows don‚Äôt work, dragging does.
* Rubber band drag mode only works in default mode.
* In normal mode deleting a track deletes the attached via, in GL mode it does not.
* In normal mode the start track shortcut starts a track immediately, in GL mode it waits for a click.

There is a 3D model feature which uses VRML world files for each part. However it only supports the subset generated by [wings3d](http://www.wings3d.com/), more complex files silently fail. Extending this to other model types is on [the roadmap](http://kicad-source-mirror.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Documentation/development/road-map/#modeling-modeling).

Some other stuff feels a bit incomplete:

* Hiding a copper layer still shows the pads.
* There is a ‚ÄúHide all copper layers but active‚Äù option for single sided work but it doesn‚Äôt hide the other side‚Äôs silkscreen.
* The rule-check doesn‚Äôt enforce track width.

Finally the library management is better than Eescheema‚Äôs but still needs a lot of work.

* Relative paths require manually using an environment variable, which
 was listed in the Eeschema library manager but not Pcbnew‚Äôs.
* There is a plugin to add github based repositories, but the option is listed even if the plugin is not installed.
* There is a plugin to add github based repositories, not git based, it uses a github webpage URL.
* Adding a library doesn‚Äôt check that the library exists, works or is valid. An error is shown later when you try and use it.
