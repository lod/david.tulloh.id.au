### Work

* Not much public work to show, mostly investigating potential manufacturing partners.
* Farnell order is dribbling in, my PCBs and AliExpress orders have been shipped. All the pieces should be ready when I get back next week.

### Play

* Went to Canberra on Friday to catch up with folk and party, staying for the week.
* Discovered [Coconuts Duo](https://www.maydaygames.com/products/coconuts-duo) amazingly fun to play and spectate. It's probably even fun sober.
* Made marbled butter biscuits (pictured). Annoyingly fragile to being burnt but fortunately I made so many that after chucking 15% I still needed two containers to store them all.

### Other

* Created a [pull-request](https://github.com/repoze/repoze.who/pull/24) to allow [repoze.who](https://repozewho.readthedocs.org/) to use non-MD5 hashes.
