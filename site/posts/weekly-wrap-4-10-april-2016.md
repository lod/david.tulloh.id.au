Attended a [car accident](https://web.archive.org/web/20221103061715/http://oceangrovevoice.com.au/uncategorized/2016-04-06/car-flips-rolls-into-ditch/) on Monday with the SES.

Baked my first successful Danish using [an online recipe](http://www.olgasflavorfactory.com/sweets/strawberry-cheesecake-danish-braid/) after two failed attempts following a recipe book. We ate one and gave one away to my Grandfather.

Designed my first PCB using KiCad and [wrote up the experience](/using-kicad/).

Had my new engineering notebooks delivered, [official CSIRO stock](http://www.publish.csiro.au/pid/1471.htm). I had a terrible time trying to find a decent book, my current one is [an art book](http://www.officeworks.com.au/shop/officeworks/p/quill-a4-art-journal-120-page-qu10314) I picked up from OfficeWorks and it wasn't ideal. The current book has a few pages left, I'll probably transition over to a new one in a week or two.
