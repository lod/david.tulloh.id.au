I have started my first work orientated project for the year. The plan is to design, build a sell a new microwave design.

As I am currently running solo I have to wear a few more hats than I would normally, some I have never really wanted. One of these is project manager. To ensure I don't get caught up working on something less critical and blow my time, or at least ensure I am aware of when it happens, I have come up with a plan.

Below is the detailed timeline of phase one, establishing the project's viability, the plan is to repost this weekly. I don't expect to keep strictly to the timeline, but at least having a base allows me to see the deviations.

I have actually detailed a fair bit of phases two and three as well but the program I am using to display the timeline struggles a bit with extensive content, I might fix it up some day.
